Throughout this project, I have refined my approach to software design and program development in ways that align with both academic requirements and my personal style. When designing software, my focus is on ensuring that others can easily pick up from where I leave off, minimizing any potential confusion. This principle often guides my decisions, even when working with the predetermined structures of school projects. For example, in CS-330, the progression from textures to lighting logically dictated where new sections of code were placed. While I might take a different approach in a freeform setting, this structure reinforced my understanding of modular design and its application in computational graphics.

This project has also honed several design and development skills. Working on a fully realized 3D scene required a deliberate design process, beginning with planning how different components would fit together and culminating in the integration of textures, lighting, and camera movement. Iteration played a significant role throughout, as each milestone provided opportunities to refine my work based on feedback and testing. I found that this iterative process not only improved the final product but also deepened my understanding of how each element contributes to the overall design.

Developing the 3D scene also introduced me to new strategies, such as breaking complex problems into smaller, manageable tasks. For instance, addressing lighting after textures ensured a logical progression that made debugging and enhancements more straightforward. Over the course of the milestones, my coding approach became more structured, with a greater emphasis on modularity and documentation. These tactics will undoubtedly be valuable in future projects, where clarity and reusability are key.

Beyond the technical skills, this project has reinforced the broader relevance of computer science in achieving my goals. Computational graphics and visualizations are invaluable tools, especially in my long-term aspiration of creating a sonochemical reactor. By simulating complex systems in a cost-effective, virtual environment, I can identify and address potential challenges before committing to expensive physical prototypes. The knowledge and skills gained from this project will not only enhance my educational journey but also position me to tackle ambitious, interdisciplinary challenges in my professional career.
